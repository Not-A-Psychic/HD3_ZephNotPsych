# Problem:
We will build a system that recommends movies to users depending on their tastes. 

Agents:
1. Genre Agents: There will be multiple agents here offered in the interface. One agent for each general genre of a movie. Each agent will have their own personality and preferences for movies. They will need to be created first and will have to be listed in the interface. Each will have their own preferences for movies that have their own genre attached to the tag. They should have some knowledge of the movie to offer to the user as required. The user should have a choice to say if they have watched the movie already or not. If they haven't watched the movie, they will be asked if they find the movie interesting. If yes, their profile will be updated with the genres of the movie.
   
2. Master Agent: This will be the first medium of communication with the user, but will be created second as it is not as important as the genres. They will ask the user some questions that will judge their usual tastes in movies, such as offering a list of movies and asking them one by one if they like, dislike or haven't heard of them. Based on their responses, their preferred genre will be identified and recommended at the end of the process. However, they will have access to all of them.

User:
The person using the system. They will be looking for a movie to watch and they have a preferred genre or genres in mind. They should access the genres they are interested in and speak to the respective agent. By the end of the interaction they should find a movie they are interested in and can further explore on their own.
